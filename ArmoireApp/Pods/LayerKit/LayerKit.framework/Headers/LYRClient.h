/**
 @abstract Returns the canonical object identifier for a given identifier.
 @discussion This method enables the migration of object identifiers created by LayerKit < v0.9.0 to the canonical
 format emitted by v0.9.0 and higher clients. If the given identifier already is a new style identifier, then it is returned. If
 the input identifier is a legacy identifier, then the canonical identifier is computed and returned. If no conversation or message can
 be found by treating the identifier as a legacy or canonical identifier then `nil` is returned (typically indicating that the content has
 not yet been synchronized).
 @param identifier The object identifier for which to return the canonical identifier.
 @return The canonical object identifier for the given input identifier or `nil` if none could be computed.
