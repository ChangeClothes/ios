/**
 @abstract The `LYRProgress` class is responsible for progress reporting.  It provides a simple interface modeled on `NSProgress` that allows for easy integration with a user interface. Changes in progress are observable via key-value observation or delegation. `LYRProgress` also provides an interface for pausing or canceling the underlying operation that it is reporting on behalf of, should the operation allow it.
 @warning Please note that when integrating an `LYRProgress` with a user interface you must take care to ensure that the updates are processed on the main thread. For performance reasons `LYRProgress` objects do not provide any guarantees about the thread context on which notifications will be delivered.
