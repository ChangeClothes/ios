/**
 @abstract The `LYRQuery` class provides a flexible querying interface for Layer content.
 @discussion Instances of `LYRQuery` are used to query the local database for messaging content. Queries target a specific queryable class
 and apply a predicate that constrains the search. Predicates are expressed in terms of a public property (such as `createdAt` or `isUnread`), an operator
 (such as 'is equal to' or 'is greater than or equal to'), and a comparison value. The sort order of the results can be affected by applying one or more
 sort descriptors which also bind to a public property and are applied in either ascending or descending order. To facilitate pagination, queries may be further
 constrained by applying a limit and offset value. Query results can be returned as either fully realized object instances, object identifiers, or as an aggregate
 count of the total number of objects matching the query.
