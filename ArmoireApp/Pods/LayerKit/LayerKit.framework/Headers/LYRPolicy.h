 @abstract The `LYRPolicy` object defines a policy that governs how communications destined for a given target user
 will be routed within Layer.
 @discussion It is important that you configure your `LYRPolicy` object appropriately before adding it to a client. Layer client objects make a copy of the policy you provide and use the copy for evaluation and enforcement. The policy objects maintained by the client are immutable and cannot be reconfigured. If you need to modify a policy, then you must make a copy of it, apply the appropriate changes, add the updated policy object to the client and remove the original policy (if appropriate).
